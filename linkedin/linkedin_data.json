Whether it is advanced MRI machines, or electronic medical records, technology is having a huge impact on the way health services are delivered. Do you want to be involved in this 'MedTech' revolution? [ POSITION DETAILS / JOB TITLE / LEVEL OF SENIORITY ] I am helping one of my long-term clients to hire an experienced software engineer to work on advanced data processing applications related to medical data. In this role, you'd be working in a supportive team of other software engineers and researchers to build MedTech software applications. The office is located in a central area of downtown Vancouver, so you'll be close to shopping, restaurants and transit in a busy and fun area of the city. [ BENEFITS / PERKS / COMPENSATION ] In this role, you will be a full-time employee and receive a competitive base salary, benefits and paid vacation. This company also supports the possibility of remote work within British Columbia, or further afield within Canada. The base salary for this role will be somewhere between $80,000 and $110,000, depending on your level of experience. [ CAREER / LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES? WHY WORK THERE ] The software development team is made up of several experienced software developers, who work closely with the medical research department. The research department generates large amounts of data which the engineering team processes and transforms into meaningful information, which is then used by various medical industry professionals. As a result, the research and development work that you'd be doing has a real impact on people's health and well-being. [ TECH STACK ] In terms of specific technologies, the engineering team uses a variety of tools and programming languages to accomplish their solutions. For example, for data intake applications, they are using GoLang. For data visualization they are using D3 javascript libraries. And for some of their core applications they are using PHP and Postgres database. But needless to say, they want to hire engineers who can build models, research new solutions, and try new technologies. [ HOW TO APPLY / INTERVIEW PROCESS ] The process all starts by getting in contact with me for an initial discussion about the role, including specifics, such as: company name, key hiring managers, and more in-depth job requirements. This is also a great opportunity to talk about your career goals and preferences, and how your goals align with this opportunity -- or even other future opportunities. If there is a suitable match, then I will make an introduction to the client on your behalf, and organize a series of interviews. The hiring process typically takes 1-2 weeks from start-to-finish.

How can you detect anomalies within more than one million time-series that we track daily? Can you separate between bots and human traffic? Can you make our across-data-centers replication into smart replication using ML models? These are just a few of the diverse questions we tackle and some which you will lead your team to crack.

Our marketing automation is managing a budget of 100Ms$ with automated bidding, our recommendation and ranking engines give billions of predictions a day based on deep learning models running in production. Our NLP lab is perfecting the chat engine in order to reduce customer frustration and there are many other examples, including fraud, pricing, experimentation, anomaly detection etc. All of this is running on our home-grown data platform, currently collecting 1.2 trillion data points every day.<br/><br/>But we are still not satisfied<br/><br/>So far, we have been using Data Science to *improve* the product, but now it\u2019s time for a revolution.

Our parent company, Booking Holdings, owns several other premier travel brands, including Booking.com, Priceline.com, Kayak, and OpenTable.com, making us the largest and fastest growing travel portfolio in the world.

We\u2019ve brought top talents from (literally) all over the world who focus relentlessly on building products which utilize ML and AI as their main edge. We know that when you infuse ML and technology, you move from good to great and that is our mission.

How can automatically answer our users\u2019 questions? How do we tune our AB testing platform to ensure we aren\u2019t optimizing noise? How do we measure experiment success to properly trade off type I and II errors? What is the ideal caching strategy for prices and how do build an ML model to implement it?
