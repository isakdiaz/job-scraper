Cryptocurrencies are providing the first piece. The second is still missing.<br/><br/><strong><u>How<br/><br/></u></strong>Creating a decentralized identity system is a hard problem. The difficulty lies in introducing scarcity without sacrificing privacy and/or self-sovereignty. We refer to this problem as Decentralized Identity Trilemma . We believe that this problem can be solved by mapping how influence flows in groups of people by tracking attention flows .<br/><br/><strong><u>What<br/><br/></u></strong>We are designing an algorithm that can tell who is influential in a group.<br/><br/><strong><u>About The Product<br/><br/></u></strong>Hive.one plays a critical role in our overall strategy. In order to deploy the algorithm we need to first demonstrate how useful it can be. That\u2019s what hive.one is for, focusing at the crypto community as a starting point.<br/><br/>It has the important function of creating a demand and giving users the ability to provide us with more data so that we can index their profiles more accurately. As such, hive.one is a means to the goal, but making it successful is essential to the company\u2019s success.<br/><br/><strong><u>About The Role<br/><br/></u></strong>Your objective is going to be to make hive.one more useful. As it is becoming more useful it will start naturally filling out the space that LinkedIn has let out - providing an overview of \u201cwho is who\u201d in the industry. It seems that LinkedIn has been mismanaged by the current leadership to the degree that it makes for an easy target. We believe that hive.one has a good chance of taking away the market from this platform. By making the product more useful, you will naturally drive it in this direction.<br/><br/>You will be working closely with Dev Lead and UX Lead to make sure they know what needs to get built and why. You will also work closely with the CEO to ensure that what is being built aligns with the broader strategy.<br/><br/><strong><u>Responsibilities<br/></u></strong><ul><li> Leadership: Communicate a compelling narrative about your product (and each existing/potential feature): what problem it solves, for whom, how and why solving this problem matters in the first place. </li><li> Impact Focus: Own key goals and prioritize outcomes and fast learning cycles. Ruthlessly prioritize and keep the team focused on the goals. </li><li> Zoom in and out: There are no tiny features when you\u2019re doing things properly. Understand how deep or wide you need to go. Break down complex initiative into a manageable chunk of work for your team. </li><li> User interviews: Making sure we understand why our users choose to use our product, how they use it and how it can be made more useful to them </li><li> External communication; Communicating new product releases, product vision and mission to our users and relevant groups (e.g. Bitcoin community cluster) </li><li> Relationship building: Maintaining relationship with key members of the community that\u2019s emerging around our product and with key members of groups that are important stakeholders (e.g. BTC or ETH community clusters) <br/></li></ul>Your Profile<br/><ul><li> You shipped product, more than once, and have experience working in product growth, engagement, or monetization </li><li> You are familiar with agile and lean software development frameworks and have used them before </li><li> You have a solid technical understanding of frontend and backend frameworks </li><li> You make data-informed decisions from A/B experiments, analytical data, and qualitative research </li><li> You understand product funnels and select the right metrics to monitor and move </li><li> You are very familiar with cryptocurrencies and the communities around, I.e. what is often referred to as \u201cBitcoin community\u201d, \u201cEthereum community\u201d, \u201cCrypto\u201d or \u201cthe crypto ecosystem\u201d. You\u2019ve owned and used cryptocurrencies and you know people who are members of these communities. You should have a good grasp of the lingo and memes that exist within these groups (e.g. \u201cHODL\u201d, \u201cBUIDL\u201d etc.) </li><li> You use Twitter, Reddit, GitHub, podcasts, Digg, 4Chan, Mastodon etc and understands what makes them successful and where they come up short. You are eager to try new platforms and are quick to learn them. </li><li> The prospect of immersing yourself for months into them to get a deep understanding of their inner workings is exciting to you. If this is not the case, or even if it's a daunting prospect, you\u2019re not going to have a good time in this role and it\u2019s probably not a fit. <br/></li></ul><strong> Culture of Critical Thinking <br/><br/></strong>One of the biggest risks we face is that we can fool ourselves into believing that we got something to work when we in fact did not. This is because verifying accuracy of our algorithm\u2019s output takes a long time and significant infrastructure. This means that an experiment that was not well-thought through enough can lead us to wasting months of work. We cannot afford that. For this reason, it is essential that we build a culture around critical thinking and closely follow the Scientific Method.<br/><br/><strong><u>If You Are Not Familiar With Critical Thinking &amp; The Scientific Method, We Encourage You To Watch The Following Videos Before Having a Chat With Us<br/><br/></u></strong><strong> Big no-no\u2019s <br/><br/></strong>Calls to authority (\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 20 years and you\u2019re just an intern...\u201d; \u201cthe world\u2019s top experts agree that\u2026\u201d, \u201cscientists agree that\u2026\u201d)<br/><br/>Discrediting ideas based on their public perception (\u201cIf you think that you are an X, Y, Z\u201d)<br/><br/>We're offering these benefits<br/><ul><li> Flexible working hours, home office days &amp; work from wherever you want periods </li><li> Free barista coffee in our light, industrial design coworking in Berlin-Mitte </li><li> Relocation and visa support <br/><br/></li></ul><strong><u>Terms<br/></u></strong><ul><li> Full time permanent </li><li>\u20ac 50-70k / year <br/></li></ul><strong> Further Reading <br/><br/></strong><strong> Instead of writing a cover letter, please answer the following questions : <br/></strong><ul><li> Imagine that you are talking to an outsider of the \u201ccrypto world\u201d.
