Our parent company, Booking Holdings, owns several other premier travel brands, including Booking.com, Priceline.com, Kayak, and OpenTable.com, making us the largest and fastest growing travel portfolio in the world. But the group is focused on entrepreneurialism, and each brand operates independently, allowing us to experiment and move fast.<br/><br/>Our 25-strong Data Science team is already responsible for a big portion of our success, we deploy ML across the board. Our marketing automation is managing a budget of 100Ms$ with automated bidding, our recommendation and ranking engines give billions of predictions a day based on deep learning models running in production. Our NLP lab is perfecting the chat engine in order to reduce customer frustration and there are many other examples, including fraud, pricing, experimentation, anomaly detection etc. All of this is running on our home-grown data platform, currently collecting 1.2 trillion data points every day.<br/><br/>But we are still not satisfied<br/><br/>So far, we have been using Data Science to *improve* the product, but now it\u2019s time for a revolution.

Our parent company, Booking Holdings, owns several other premier travel brands, including Booking.com, Priceline.com, Kayak, and OpenTable.com, making us the largest and fastest growing travel portfolio in the world. But the group is focused on entrepreneurialism, and each brand operates independently, allowing us to experiment and move fast.<br/><br/>Our 25-strong Data Science team is already responsible for a big portion of our success, we deploy ML across the board. Our marketing automation is managing a budget of 100Ms$ with automated bidding, our recommendation and ranking engines give billions of predictions a day based on deep learning models running in production. Our NLP lab is perfecting the chat engine in order to reduce customer frustration and there are many other examples, including fraud, pricing, experimentation, anomaly detection etc. All of this is running on our home-grown data platform, currently collecting 1.2 trillion data points every day.<br/><br/>But we are still not satisfied<br/><br/>So far, we have been using Data Science to *improve* the product, but now it\u2019s time for a revolution. We want to use data science in every aspect of the product, front or back, make it clear to the customer that we are giving them a superb experience from all aspects and empower the entirety of our tech team to utilize our data in real time.<br/><br/>A vision like this requires a leader that can combine strategy, execution, communication and intelligence to take materialize these ideas all the way to the customer, are you that person?<br/><br/><strong><u>As The Global Head Of Data Science, You Will<br/><br/></u></strong><strong>Manage and grow our DS teams,</strong> our team is mostly MSc and PhD graduates from top universities around the world, including Stanford, Harvard and others.
