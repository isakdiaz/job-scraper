However, most Transaction Directors have been in the mid to low six figure ranges since this compensation structure was adopted.

With offices throughout the world, we are in touch with all the major acquirers and consolidators who are constantly seeking both on and off market opportunities across all sectors. The enterprise value of our transactions falls broadly within the $2 million to $300 million range, with most being between $5 million and $20 million. Our unique and dynamic international offering presents our clients with unparalleled global coverage, allowing them access through our exclusive databases and business intelligence facilities to both international markets and local representation.</p><p>\nOur client base consists almost entirely of owners actively involved in businesses they founded decades earlier. At times, multiple family members are involved. Our clients seek either an opportunity to exit their business or the means to ensure its continued future growth. They look to our company to find both an acquirer with the right fit and a transaction that provides maximum value and the correct structure. As a result of the dynamics of this market, our bespoke process has been developed specifically to handle not only the business aspects of these transactions but also their personal and emotional components.</p><p>\nWe handle clients in any industry but a disproportionate share of the Tampa office\u2019s closings have involved companies involved in the healthcare sector and software developers. Closings have increased year-over-year with over 100 closings company-wide last year and the Tampa office crossing 30 in 2017 for the first time.</p><p>\nBenchmark International began in the United Kingdom over a decade ago. Our Tampa headquarters opened in 2013 and continues to grow as our domestic client base and international buyer-contacts expand. We expanded into Texas January 2016. 2017 brought office openings in South Africa, Ireland and the United Kingdom. A new Nashville office will open in January 2018.</p><p>\nWe offer our clients a unique business proposition that has resonated well with the US market as it has previously with markets in other countries. Recognizing that the US M&amp;A markets are the most robust in the world, particularly in this coveted middle-market range, we are planning to continue to grow our US presence in the coming years. Coming onboard now presents you the opportunity to ride this wave of growth. Benchmark International has always promoted from within and we look forward to bringing you onboard as the next generation of Benchmark International\u2019s leaders.</p><p>\nUnfortunately, Benchmark International is not in a position to sponsor visas for candidates in its US offices at this time.</p></div><p></p></div>"}, {"id": 13484391, "source": "indeed", "position": "Senior Software Engineer- ServiceNow", "company": "CoBank", "city": "Denver", "country": ["United States"], "maxSalary": "0", "minSalary": "0", "currency": "USD", "language": ["English"], "tags": ["qa", "sql", "testing", "database", "design", "indeed"], "category": "Developer", "epoch": 1569640355, "url": "https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=4079cf6d9e4562e8&fccid=f5470c2c6f246277&vjs=3", "imgUrl": "indeed", "description": "<div class=\"jobsearch-jobDescriptionText\" id=\"jobDescriptionText\"><div>At CoBank, our Software Engineer will analyze, configure, test, and debug commercial off the shelf (COTS) applications.
